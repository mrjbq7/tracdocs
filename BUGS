* Collision detection incorrectly uses subversion last-revision-id instead of
  the page's last-revision-id.

* Syntax highlighting "guesses" the correct language to highlight and thus
  occassionally highlights a little strangely in literal-blocks.  (Mostly 
  only applies to blocks that contain numbers).

* Editing through the web page creates an incorrect subversion diff, showing
  the entire page as having changed when only a small part actually did.

Description
===========

The 'tracdocs' project is a plugin for the 'trac' project management tool.

Many documents exists adjacent to the code that is being developed and
managed. These documents are not conveniently stored in a wiki due to the lack
of offline access and editing. Also, a wiki tends to be less structured than
the documentation that lives with source code.

The 'tracdocs' plugin adds a "Docs" tab to the trac project. Underneath this
tab can be found all of the documentation that the current logged in user has
access to.

Some features:

* Uses RestructuredText as a markup language.
* Supports inline images and links.
* Highlights source code using google-code-prettify.
* Supports editing through Subversion and the Trac website.
* Handles user permission using Subversion authorization.

Note: this plugin respects the access rights of the user that is logged in.


Installation
============

The 'tracdocs' plugin can be installed using standard::

    python setup.py install


Configuration
=============

It is configured in the trac.ini file by enabling the component and
configuring the path within the Subversion repository to store the wiki
documents::

    [components]
    tracdocs.* = enabled

    [docs]
    root = wiki/trunk

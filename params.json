{"name":"TracDocs","tagline":"Subversion-backed wiki plugin for Trac.","body":"# TracDocs\r\n\r\nThe TracDocs project is a plugin for the 'trac' project management tool.\r\n\r\nMany documents exists adjacent to the code that is being developed and\r\nmanaged. These documents are not conveniently stored in a wiki due to the lack\r\nof offline access and editing. Also, a wiki tends to be less structured than\r\nthe documentation that lives with source code.\r\n\r\nThe TracDocs plugin adds a \"Docs\" tab to the trac project. Underneath this\r\ntab can be found all of the documentation that the current logged in user has\r\naccess to.\r\n\r\nSome features:\r\n\r\n* Uses RestructuredText as a markup language.\r\n* Supports inline images and links.\r\n* Highlights source code using google-code-prettify.\r\n* Supports editing through Subversion and the Trac website.\r\n* Handles user permission using Subversion authorization.\r\n* Supports downloading binaries with proper mime-types for non-text files.\r\n\r\nNote: this plugin respects the access rights of the user that is logged in.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe TracDocs plugin can be installed using standard:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ easy_install tracdocs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, grab the sources and build using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nIt is configured in the ``trac.ini`` file by enabling the component and\r\nconfiguring the path within the Subversion repository to store the wiki\r\ndocuments:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[components]\r\ntracdocs.* = enabled\r\n\r\n[docs]\r\nroot = wiki/trunk\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, it will show the title of the directory that you are navigating,\r\nbut if you create an index.txt file in the directory, it will use that\r\ninstead, allowing you to put additional documentation at the top of a\r\ndirectory structure.\r\n\r\nIt uses the ``WIKI_VIEW`` permissions to control access to the documentation\r\npages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

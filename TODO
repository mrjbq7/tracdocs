Some various ideas for improving tracdocs (in no particular order):

* Support adding files and directories.

* Support deleting files and directories.

* Support moving files and directories.

* Support view history of files.

* Better binary file support (fix arbitrary 512 kb file size limit)

* Support multiple "projects", each with their own ``docs`` directories.

* Hide directories starting with "."?

* Change display to multi-column for "large" directories?

* WYSIWYG editor for ReST.

* Support relative links, to other tracdoc files.
